# **Rolling Sphere and Statistical Analysis for Influenza Adaptation Study**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all **R scripts and datasets** required for reproducing the **rolling sphere analysis** and **statistical analyses** from:

> **Costa RM, Acosta-Alvarez L, Curtis K, Zarbock K, Kelleher J, et al.**  
> *Influenza virus evolution and defective genome formation are shaped by host genotype and sex* (2025).  
> [10.1101/2025.02.26.638946v1]

Scripts are present for:
- **Rolling sphere** for detection of positively selected mutations hotspots
- **Viral titer statistical analyses**
- **Weight loss statistical analyses**
- **Mortality statistical analyses**
- **Genomic deletions detection and statistical analyses**

## **Contents**
- `scripts/` – R scripts for statistical and 3D mapping analyses.
